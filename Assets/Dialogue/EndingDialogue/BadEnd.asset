  dialogue:
  - You just finished clearing out your workspace after what you considered a successful
    day when the guards stormed in and carried you off.
  - '''Will I finally be free?'' you thought to yourself. You eagerly and compliantly
    went along. A bright flash of light as you left the prison was the first thing
    you saw.'
  - The next was a clear, beautiful blue sky and luscious green grass you had only
    dreamed about touching.
  - 'Unfortunately, the next thing you saw was what looked to be a large blade over
    an empty headrest. '
  - Despite your best efforts, the king declared you a witch and you were sentenced
    to death. You looked up to the sky one last time and enjoyed your last taste
    of freedom.
  - Thanks For Playing! ~Ending 3/4~
