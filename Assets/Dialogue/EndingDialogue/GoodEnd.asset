  dialogue:
  - Finally, you've reached the end of your journey.
  - The king approved of your efforts and decided to grant you recess priveledges.
  - You thoroughly enjoyed your 10 minutes of sunlight before being brought back
    down to the Depths of the dungeon to resume your work.
  - You noted that maybe if you work hard for the next 20 years, you will earn the
    right to leave the dungeons. You quickly dismissed that thought knowing there
    was no way this would happen.
  - Thanks For Playing! ~Ending 1/4~
