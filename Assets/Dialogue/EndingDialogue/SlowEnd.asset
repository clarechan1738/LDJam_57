  dialogue:
  - As much as you tried to resist the urge to sit down and do absolutely nothing,
    your legs gave out and your will went shortly after.
  - In the depths of your despair, you sat and waited, and withered away. But to
    you, this was a small victory.
  - Knowing that you showed the king who entrapped you here who was in charge.
  - Thanks For Playing! ~Ending 4/4~
