  dialogue:
  - At last, you finished your last day of work before your long-promised break time!
  - You waited and waited for the guards to release you for your recess but to no
    avail, no one came.
  - You wondered what you could have done but then you recalled that you most definitely
    handed out a few wrong potions. You thought 'how could that possibly be the reason?'
  - But you knew very well that perfection is demanded of you. You noted that you
    were lucky they didn't execute you.
  - With that thought, you sat down and waited for the next customer or guard or
    someone to show up but no one came.
  - Thanks For Playing! ~Ending 2/3~
