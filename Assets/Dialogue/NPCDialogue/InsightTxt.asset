  - Good evening. I assume a fellow magic practitioner such as yourself would understand
    why I have arrived.
  - Oh, you don't read minds? Well, my dear, I do! I can tell you are feeling a sense
    of awe of my abilities.
  - While I adore the praise, please move along with my Potion Of Insight. I need
    to keep my third eye sharp!
