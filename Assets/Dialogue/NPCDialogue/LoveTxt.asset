  - Hello, yes. I don't have time for introductions. Please make me a Love Potion
    ASAP.
  - Why do I need it? Why do you need to know?
  - '*Sigh* Alright. My wife has been a nightmare lately but she won''t sign the
    divorce papers. I want to help her move on so we can move forward with the divorce.'
